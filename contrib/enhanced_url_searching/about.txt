== Description ==

Adds better searching for file / directory names, by tokenizing the URL and putting it to an auxiliary field.

The problems that I wanted to address are:
  1. Index unknown file types, using only the url
  2. Search for exact filenames (with or without extension)
  3. Search for partial filenames
